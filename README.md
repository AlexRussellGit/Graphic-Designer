3D-modeling desinger which simulate 3 axis (x,y,z).
Turns around, zoom in/out, creates and edit obects (line). 

Lines can be:
- created (random or by input)
- choosed by mouse
- deleted (chosen or all)
- turned around any axis (chosen line's)
- moved in any deraction of 3 axis (chosen line's)
- bigger/smaller (chosen line's)
- saved on/loaded from computer

Also a morfing simulation is implemented: the program includes a sphere which slowley changes into a squere.
